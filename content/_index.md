Hi! My name is Wenxuan, people call me Lillian. <br>
I am broadly interested in the integration of constructivist principles with various technologies and how they enrich learning experiences. 
I design innovative methods to enrich learning environments, leveraging data to uncover insights into student collaboration and learning processes. One of my proudest achievements is designing the playful learning experiences for two robotic products, the <a href = "https://www.dji.com/robomaster-ep">RoboMaster S1/EP</a> and <a href = "https://www.dji.com/robomaster-tt">RoboMaster TT/Tello</a>, which are now used in schools worldwide. <br>
From synchronized eye-tracking to personalized learning algorithms, I'm constantly exploring ways to make education more engaging, accessible, and effective for all students.From synchronized eye-tracking to personalized learning algorithms, I'm constantly exploring ways to make education more engaging, accessible, and effective for all students.
