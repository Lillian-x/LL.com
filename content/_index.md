Hi! My name is Wenxuan, people call me Lillian. I am broadly interested in the integration of constructivist principles with various technologies and how they enrich learning experiences. 
My work thrives at the confluence of education and technology. I design innovative methods to enrich learning environments, leveraging data to uncover insights into student collaboration and learning processes. From synchronized eye-tracking to personalized learning algorithms, I'm constantly exploring ways to make education more engaging, accessible, and effective for all students.
