Hello there! I'm thrilled to introduce myself and share a glimpse into my vibrant world. As an innovative and passionate EdTech professional, I'm on a mission to revolutionize learning experiences through the power of technology. With a unique blend of academic expertise from Harvard and USC, encompassing education, computer science, and data analytics, I bring a multidisciplinary approach to the field.

My journey has been fueled by a love for teaching, instructional design, and a belief in the transformative potential of data-driven solutions. Whether designing engaging curricula, developing cutting-edge products, or leveraging learning analytics, I strive to create personalized and inclusive experiences that empower students to thrive.

At the core of my work is a commitment to promoting equity and accessibility in education. I'm driven by a passion for making STEM subjects approachable and inspiring for all learners, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds.

With a relentless spirit of innovation, I approach challenges with creative problem-solving and a willingness to push boundaries. My diverse experiences as an educator, programmer, designer, and lifelong learner have equipped me with a unique perspective and a deep appreciation for the art of teaching and learning.

I'm excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals and organizations, combining our collective expertise to shape the future of education through technology-driven solutions that inspire, engage, and empower students worldwide.
