# The Motivational Dimensions of RoboMaster: The STEM Learning Experiences with a Robot


## Introduction

The pace of innovation is accelerating globally, increasing the competition for scientific and technical talent. This has heightened attention to effective and inclusive STEM teaching and learning. Researchers and educators have proposed various methods to engage students more effectively, one of which includes using robots in introductory programming. This involves building or using an interactive physical system that combines both software and hardware elements. Physical computing with robots has proven to attract students to STEM and increase their motivation to learn programming and computational skills.

The RoboMaster S1 (RMS1), an educational robot inspired by DJI's annual RoboMaster robotics competition, is designed to enhance the learning of robotics, programming, AI, math, and physics through engaging features and gameplay. An application that controls the robot allows for omnidirectional movement, gel bead launching, and provides an immersive first-person view driving experience.

## Learning Experiences in RoboMaster

### Solo Mode

Users typically begin exploring the RMS1 in Solo Mode, learning quickly about the robot's components and functionalities. The mode provides a first-person view, mimicking a video game experience, where users can control the robot and utilize its features like shooting tiny gel beads.

### Battle Mode

In Battle Mode, users can sync multiple RMS1s to compete against each other, shooting gel beads or laser shots at sensors on other robots. This mode combines the excitement of e-sports with theoretical knowledge learning.

### The Lab

The Lab section offers advanced functionalities where users can program the robot to perform more complex tasks. It supports both Scratch and Python programming languages, providing a comprehensive STEM learning experience through project-based tutorials.

## Motivational Aspects

The design of RMS1 and its application focus heavily on motivational aspects, using elements from Self-Determination Theory (SDT). SDT suggests that intrinsic motivation is enhanced when activities meet basic psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness:

- **Competence**: Users feel capable as they navigate through different modes, facing challenges that match their skill levels.
- **Autonomy**: The app offers various choices that empower users to control their learning pathways and strategies.
- **Relatedness**: Users are part of a community of robotics enthusiasts, enhancing the social aspect of learning.

## Conclusion

The RMS1 provides a dynamic and interactive learning experience that effectively motivates students to engage with STEM concepts. By integrating gaming elements with educational content, RMS1 appeals to a broad range of learners, fostering both engagement and educational outcomes.
