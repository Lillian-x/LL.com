This is an educational tool I designed in line with constructivist learning theory, aiming to stimulate children's creativity and problem-solving abilities.

Originally, the target audience for the robot was children in the higher grades of elementary school and above. The design of this programming card is to enable younger children to experience the joy of AI programming and interacting with robots.

It includes a total of 30 fun levels, encouraging players to use code to control the chassis, turret, and other parts of the S1 robot to complete tasks such as "cross-stepping" and "dancing a twist waist dance." The challenge card integrates physical and mathematical knowledge points into the tasks, allowing children to learn abstract concepts through robots. The difficulty of the tasks will gradually increase with the progress of the challenge, adapting to players with different levels of knowledge. We integrate knowledge from physics, mathematics, and other disciplines into programming tasks, helping children to connect abstract concepts with practical applications for interdisciplinary learning.

Each challenge card features an independent task. Users need to follow the clues on the card to determine and fill in the missing code information, enabling the robot to smoothly execute the task and complete the level.

I actually embeded a little hint: The color of each card actually corresponds to the colors displayed by the various programming modules in the RoboMaster app. I believe you will soon discover the secrets to conquering the challenges!

We have organized some offline activities in our stores and clubs across the country, inviting children to come and play.

## Design Philosophy:

- **User-Centered**: All designs revolve around the learning needs and interests of the usersâ€”the children.
- **Interactivity**: Through interaction with the RoboMaster S1, children learn programming in a playful environment.
- **Adaptability**: The challenge card's difficulty adapts to children of different ages and knowledge levels, ensuring every child can learn at their own pace.
- **Educational Value**: Ensuring the programming challenge card is not just a tool for entertainment but also an educational product that imparts knowledge and cultivates skills.
- **Innovation**: Encouraging children to think innovatively, not confined to standard answers, seeking multiple possible solutions.

## Educational Attributes Introduction:

This programming challenge card adheres to **constructivist learning** theory, an education approach centered on the student, emphasizing the construction of knowledge through active engagement and social interaction.

Children will learn the basics of programming and understand the working principles of robots through **hands-on operation** with the RoboMaster S1, deepening their understanding and retention through **doing**.

The programming challenge card is designed with tasks that **escalate in complexity**, starting with simple commands and progressively guiding children to master more advanced programming concepts and skills.

Each level is a mini-challenge, requiring children to think critically and apply their knowledge to find solutions, fostering their **problem-solving abilities**.

Through the **immediate feedback** from the RoboMaster S1, children can quickly understand whether their programming is correct, with timely positive or negative feedback helping them adjust their learning strategies.


## Areas for Future Improvement:
During our testing phase, we have identified two key areas that require further enhancement to ensure a more comprehensive and engaging educational experience with this card set.

Firstly, **Social Interaction** needs to be more robustly integrated into the challenge card's design. While the current setup allows for teamwork, there is a need to create more structured opportunities for children to engage in meaningful discussions, collaboration, and communication within a team setting. This could involve designing tasks that specifically require collective problem-solving and peer-to-peer interaction to foster a deeper understanding of teamwork dynamics.

Secondly, **Creativity Cultivation** is another area that can be further developed. Although the open-ended tasks are intended to inspire imaginative thinking, we aim to provide additional support and guidance to help children explore a wider range of creative solutions. This may include offering more varied and complex challenges that push the boundaries of conventional thinking, as well as incorporating elements that encourage children to experiment with different approaches and to appreciate the process of innovation.

By focusing on these areas, we can refine the programming challenge card to not only enhance the educational value but also to inspire a richer learning experience that nurtures both social skills and creative problem-solving abilities in children.
