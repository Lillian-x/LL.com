>RoboMaster S1 supports two powerful programming languages, Scratch and Python. The scratch programming consists of 46 programmable blocks, six categories of AI programming modules, and a vast array of programming blocks, coupled with six PWM interfaces. To view details of those blocks, see this [programming guide](https://dl.djicdn.com/downloads/ROBOMASTER_EP/20200515/RoboMaster%20EP%20Programming%20Guide%20V1.0.pdf).

I developed the "Road to Mastery" course to guide users through this rich landscape of programming possibilities. Available directly on the App, this course is an invitation to explore, learn, and master the art of coding with the RoboMaster S1. Engage with interactive lessons, practical exercises, and creative challenges that will help users unlock the full potential of their RoboMaster S1 and their own coding skills.

## Design Objective:

The primary objective in designing this interactive course is to foster a foundational understanding of programming concepts in a manner that is both accessible and entertaining. We aim to achieve this by integrating project-based learning modules that are not only instructive but also stimulating.

By facilitating real-time interactions with the robot, learners are given the opportunity to delve into the intricacies of mechanical systems and gain a hands-on appreciation for the principles that govern them. This tactile approach to learning is complemented by an immersive exposure to artificial intelligence technologies.

Our course is meticulously crafted to guide learners through a series of progressively challenging projects, each designed to illuminate different aspects of programming and robotics. Through this journey, we aspire to cultivate curiosity, critical thinking, and a deep appreciation for the fusion of technology and intelligence.

As learners navigate through the "Road to Mastery" course, they will not only develop proficiency in programming with the "RoboMaster S1" but also gain insights into the broader implications of AI in the context of modern robotics.
