You\u0026rsquo;re not alone! Our study delves into the emotional attachment between humans and dogs, using cutting-edge multi-modal data analytics technology.\nWe were interested about the relationship between people’s emotional states and electrothermal activity with how readily accessible they are from their pets when talking about them? How does looking at a picture of their dog affect, if at all, those variables?\nHypothesis: Individuals living away from their dogs will express stronger and more negative (sad) emotions as well as demonstrate higher levels of electrothermal activity when recalling and telling a story about their dog.\nThe Experiment # We recruited 8 participants, half living with their dogs and half away from them. We used storytelling to cue emotional responses, tracking their emotions and electrodermal activity (EDA) in real-time using Empatica E4, a wristband tha monitors physiological signals. Participants shared stories about their dogs, and we analyzed their emotional transitions using Markov Chains. All participants were monitored using Face.API and the Empatica E4 while they went through our timed activity. We utilized a video with instructions and a timer on screen to pace the conversation. Point of note that when you’re happy or neutral, you tend to stay that way.\nOther emotions tend to converge back to happy. There were some sad moments and our participants noted that the wave of nostalgia made them feel that way (though it’s interesting that it is the withs that expressed that more physically). Key Findings # Happy Memories: Participants mostly shared happy stories about their dogs, with a significant difference in happy expressions between those living away from their dogs (~27% difference). Emotional Transitions: Our Markov Chain analysis revealed that individuals tend to remain in neutral or happy states when talking about their dogs. However, those away from their dogs showed more surprised, disgusted, and angry expressions. EDA Insights: We found a negative correlation between EDA changes and dog proximity, indicating that individuals living with their dogs tend to have lower EDA changes. What else we wanted to do\u0026hellip; # Our study demonstrates the potential of multi-modal data analytics in understanding the complex emotional relationships between humans and animals. Future research can expand on this by exploring other contexts, ages, and types of pets.\nConclusion # The emotional attachment between humans and dogs is undeniable. By leveraging innovative technologies, we can gain a deeper understanding of this bond and its implications for our wellbeing. So, the next time you\u0026rsquo;re away from your furry friend, remember that you\u0026rsquo;re not alone in feeling that emotional tug!\nThis is A Group Project I collaborated with Amy Chiu and Collin Liu, who share a passion for exploring the human-animal bond using innovative technologies. I thank all the participants and their cuuuuutteeeee companions.\n","date":"28 8月 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/1724828692317-multimodal-data-analysis/","section":"Projects","summary":"A fun Multi-Modal Data Analytics Project: Exploring the Emotional Bond Between Humans and Dogs During Separataion # Are you a dog lover who\u0026rsquo;s ever experienced separation anxiety from your furry friend?","title":"Emotional Bond Between Humans and Dogs?","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"28 8月 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/example/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Example","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 8月 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"28 8月 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tag/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tag","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"16 7月 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/ai/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"AI","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"16 7月 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/data-analytics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Data Analytics","type":"tags"},{"content":"Excited to share that I recently completed a transformative Hackweek as part of the ISEA (Innovation Science for Education Analytics) program, which I\u0026rsquo;ve been fortunate to be a part of for the last six months.

Our concept, TeleCon (Tele + Silicon), is a pneumatically actuated flexible haptic wearable device. It comprises a soft silicone patch engineered as a self-contained soft-robotic wearable that can be worn anywhere on the user\u0026rsquo;s skin. TeleCon provides tactile stimuli by leveraging kinesthetic cues from force-feedback silicon actuators that push against the user\u0026rsquo;s body. The innovative wearable design allows for dynamic tactile sensations and force feedback to be directly applied to the wearer\u0026rsquo;s skin.\nBy combining cutting-edge soft robotics, haptics, and wearable technology, our interdisciplinary team created TeleCon as a novel haptic interface. This compact, unobtrusive device can enable new forms of telecommunication, remote physical guidance, and embodied human-computer interaction. The project brings together expertise spanning product design, mechanical engineering, human-computer interaction, and materials science. It exemplifies how collaborations across diverse domains can spark creative innovations at the intersection of multiple disciplines.\nIdeation # We realized that haptics, or say the sensation of touch, has been used in many applications. For entertainment and education. The use of haptic devices to produce targeted stimuli have been developed rapidly. We want to use it to advocate the paradigms of tele-presence and tele-communication,\nBased on existing papers, wearable haptic devices have mainly focused on 1) domain-specific design like gloves or rings on a finger that simulate sensations and 2) a Real time haptic feedback. Our goals of this project are creating a self-contained wearable device that can be where anywhere on the user’s body and provide application scenarios and an interface for both real time and Past and present telepresence interaction.\nWe divided Telepresence application scenarios into two categories. First, is a real time feedback between two different users in a remote setting. We imagined this could be used for sharing emotional tactile sensations between people in a long distance relationship or a remote exercise and workout during Covid time.\nThe second category is interaction between the past and present. We explored an interface that saves patterns and forces of inflation on our device and shares the tactile sensation with other people. Using the application we developed, users can retrieve the tactile memory and remember and feel past sensations that no longer exist, such as your pet\u0026rsquo;s paws, heartbeats, and more. Visual and auditory information can be easily saved on currently used daily devices and shared on social media. However, tactile sensations are still difficult to save and share within currently available interfaces.\nReal time Telepresent Applications # TeleCon allow us to touch specific body part, give a hug remotely, feel the telepresent heart rates to understand emotions. TeleCon serves as on-body training assistance. Ideally, it will be a whole-body suit that allows your coach to give accurate on-body guidance for your body training remotely. For example your coach want to correct your training movement, the exact area will inflate to inform you of which muscle you should use for certain training.\nPast and Present Applications # As we know that visual and auditory data can be easily saved in current daily used devices, tactile sensation is still difficult to be saved and shared with current interface. We envision that haptic sensation can be saved within the form of patterns and forces of inflation on our device, so that we can store and memorize the intimate haptic memory forever.\nThe sensation of feeling the shape of an object when grasping it in Virtual Reality (VR) enhances a sense of presence and the ease of object manipulation. When a user\u0026rsquo;s hand encounters an object in a mixed reality world, pneumatic patches on hands and wrist inflate in an appropriate shape, ready for grasping. Then the patches deflate when the object is no longer in play.\nFabrication # We started from ideation, finding ways to control each pixel. Then we created simulation using rhino and grasshoppers, modelled different shapes and pattern of prototypes with 3d print molds, silicone casting. Finally we implemented the controlling the using flowIO and Arduino.\nFor the software part. We have designed two types of input sources for different application scenarios. One is designed for the present to present scenarios world. Another input source is from the virtual world. Extracting essential variables from VR devices. We rely on the software development to synchronize the two pads. We compute the inputs into several variables here, including ports, inflation time, pneumatic actions(Inflation, Vacuum, Release, and Stop), and PWM values of the signal.\n","date":"20 7月 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/1721502314664-project2/","section":"Projects","summary":"Introduction # This is a team project I collaborated on with artists from the Harvard Graduate School of Design and MIT Media Lab.","title":"TeleCon, a pneumatically actuated flexible haptic wearable device","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"28 2月 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/about/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"About","type":"tags"},{"content":"My Name in Pinyin is Wenxuan Liu.

We conducted many rounds of surveys, interviews, focus groups, and tests to help design and validate the learning experiences. We continued to iterate and develop new content after the launch. However, at 2022, when I was at Harvard Graduate School of Education, taking a course by Prof. Chris Dede, I learned a lot about Motivation and Learning. I wrote down this evaluation piece to revisit and reflect the existing learning experiences of RMS1 so that my colleagues at DJI could further improve this innovative product.\nIntroduction # The pace of innovation is accelerating globally and with it the competition for scientific and technical talent. It has increased attention to effective and inclusive STEM teaching and learning. Researchers and educators have proposed various approaches for engaging students more. One of these approaches is to use robots in introductory programming learning which includes building or using an interactive physical system with a combination of software and hardware (McGill, 2012). In fact, physical computing with robots is a proven concept to attract students to STEM learning and to increase their motivation to learn programming and related computational skills(Janke, E., Brune, P., \u0026amp; Studt, R,2013). Not only in classrooms, it has also been demonstrated that using robots as tools can improve students’ content knowledge in STEM fields and critical thinking skills in an informal learning environment (Barker \u0026amp; Ansorge, 2007, p. 231). RoboMaster S1 (RMS1) is an intelligent educational robot inspired by DJI\u0026rsquo;s annual RoboMaster robotics competition. According to the website, RMS1 aims to let users dive into the world of robotics, programming, AI, math and physics through exciting intelligent features and captivating gameplay(\u0026ldquo;RoboMaster S1 - DJI\u0026rdquo;, 2022). An app that controls the robot supports omnidirectional movement gel bead launching and provides an immersive first-person view driving experience.\nIn this post, I analyze the learning experiences in the RoboMaster app, including three main sections: “Solo”, learning through free control of the robot, “Battle”, learning through competition with others, and “Lab”, learning STEM knowledge through tutorials. The motivational dimensions of these experiences encourage players to develop their robot controlling skills, strive for mastery in the \u0026ldquo;Battle\u0026rdquo; mode, and continually expand their STEM knowledge. These findings will be shared with the RoboMaster development team to assist them in creating more engaging learning experiences for users of various personalities.\nLearning Experiences in RoboMaster # Solo Mode # Usually, users start exploring the RMS1 from solo mode. This process allows the user to quickly learn about the robot\u0026rsquo;s components and functions. When controlling RMS1, the app defaults to a first-person view of the action, letting users steer the robot just like they were inside it—similar to playing a first-person video game. Users can also fire the tiny gel beads with a tap or switch to an ultra red “laser” shott (a little flash of colored light with a pew-pew sound). Moreover, the camera allows users to film videos and take snapshots. Thanks to computer vision technology, users can even identify a person within the frame and have the RMS1 follow them around.\nBattle Mode # The app also offers access to the Battle mode, in which two or more RMS1s can sync up and shoot gel beads or laser shots at each other’s sensors. RMS1 has a special sensor system that can calculate the attack value based on damage in the physical world and display the health point in real time. This battle mode combines the fun of e-sports and theoretical knowledge learning into one.\nThe Lab # To leverage RMS1’s capabilities in some AI functions and win the battles, users can click into the Lab section to make the robot with more functions by learning and trying to program. In “DIY programming”, the app supports Scratch and Python programming languages, allowing users to experience math, physics, geometry, and AI technology in a cutting-edge and inspiring way. In the \u0026lsquo;Lab\u0026rsquo; section, there is a \u0026lsquo;Road to Mastery\u0026rsquo; subsection that contains eleven project-based tutorials using blockly programming language. The app tracks users’ learning progress in those tutorials, and a sidebar shows the percentage of completion for three concept branches: programming, control, and AI.\nThe educational problems # RMS1 was designed for users to learn with a tangible robot, bridge the digital world with the physical one, and bring abstract theories to life through practical operations. The learning experiences aim to help youth understand STEM concepts, and most importantly, motivate them to learn. Motivation is a critical condition for productive learning (Pintrich \u0026amp; Schunk, 2002) and it also affects the acquisition and demonstration of higher-order thinking skills (Wolpert, 2008). Therefore, this study aims to find out whether the learning experiences with RMS1 are effective in creating motivation to learn STEM. Additionally, this study asked how RMS1 users experience their informal learning environment to understand whether and in what ways they find themselves engaging. Compare the findings to claims made by advocates of learning with Robots. In the next section, I will first introduce the theories of motivation from the learning experiences in the app. Then I will connect them with the design elements from each experience. In the feedback and interview section, discuss the comments and feedback from the user, data collected from the survey, and the interview findings. In the overall assessment section, present an overall comparison between the strengths and limits of the motivational aspects in the three main experiences. Finally, a discussion concludes the study with a discussion of future opportunities and challenges.\nTheoretical Framework for Analyzing this Experience # In order to analyze the learning experience of this app, let\u0026rsquo;s first assume a learning situation. Thus the learning activities happen in an informal learning setting. According to the website\u0026rsquo;s guideline age of use, in this study, I assume the user\u0026rsquo;s age range to 14 years old and above, with no prior experience with programming in Scratch. Based on this setting, I came to identify the features that motivate users in the learning process. I would like to evaluate the features that motivate learners through the perspective of the Self-Determination Theory. Lastly, to encourage learners to continue exploring STEM concepts, I would like to review the existing tutorials according to the theory of ZPD.\nSelf-Determination # As online entertainment, social networks, and digital gaming in all kinds of platforms provide competing interests for teenagers\u0026rsquo; attention, how to motivate the academically unmotivated becomes increasingly pressing. Players often spend extended time playing games to gain mastery over the challenges posed and to progress to higher levels of the game. The idea of Robomaster was actually inspired by robot animation and some video games. RMS1 kept the same game gene but aimed to apply players’ desire for progress to motivate STEM learning intrinsically. To investigate the impact of increasing intrinsic motivation, the theoretical basis of this study is the Self-determination theory (SDT). The underlying belief of this theory is that individuals’ intrinsic motivation can be triggered by three basic psychological needs: competence, autonomy, and relatedness(Ryan and Deci, 2000).\nCompetence - “I want to be able to do a good job.” # The feeling of competence is a sense that one is effective at doing something. It is really commonly studied in psychology as a core psychological need. Essentially, the learning environments and settings can have a big impact on the level of competence.\nSolo mode: Solo mode introduces users to quickly master how to control the robot\u0026rsquo;s movements and follow the prompts to try out the robot\u0026rsquo;s various functions. Once the user has mastered the basic operations, they can engage in two practices designed to continually enhance their competence as they progress in controlling the robot: \u0026lsquo;Target Practice\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Target Race\u0026rsquo;.\u0026quot; These mini-game-like experiences can help users achieve high levels of competence in various skills and abilities, such as problem-solving, and reaction time.\nBattle mode: This mode offers three mini-competitions that allow users to compete against others. The difficulty levels of these competitions are designed to provide a progressive experience, enabling users to continually enhance their competence as they advance in controlling the robot and programming. As shown in image, the \u0026ldquo;Conquest Mode\u0026rdquo; employs a simplified version of the competition system used in the RoboMaster University Championship, which is a Player versus Player (PvP) live-firing robotics competition. Purposeful and goal-directed competitions can motivate users to be more tenacious and persevere through challenges. Competitions serve as an engaging approach to hands-on learning, raising students\u0026rsquo; interest in acquiring related conceptual knowledge and skills. Robotics competitions have gained increasing popularity within the technology and engineering educational community. As Caron (2010) states, \u0026ldquo;Competitions add a level of engagement that is often hard to achieve in a traditional classroom setting\u0026rdquo; (p. 21).\nLab: During gameplay in the Solo mode and Battle mode, users may encounter prompts instructing them to utilize \u0026ldquo;Skills\u0026rdquo; during operation. Users can acquire new skills for the robot either through the \u0026lsquo;DIY programming\u0026rsquo; option in the Lab or by completing the \u0026lsquo;Road to Mastery\u0026rsquo; tutorials. The \u0026lsquo;Road to Mastery\u0026rsquo; comprises eleven Blockly programming tutorials, starting with the \u0026ldquo;Beginner Guide\u0026rdquo; and progressively increasing in difficulty. Users can learn to control the robot, starting with simple tasks like spinning and culminating in identifying and attacking specific targets. The lessons become increasingly complex, covering dozens of different tiles that determine the robot\u0026rsquo;s movement. Striking a balance between difficulty and user skill was crucial for the success of these tutorials. Upon completing a tutorial, users receive star ratings, indicating their effectiveness in achieving the programming goals. These features provide performance feedback and acknowledge the players\u0026rsquo; prowess, which are key to satisfying their need for competence, as discussed by Ryan and Deci (2000a).\nAutonomy - “I want to choose the things I do.” # Autonomy is the ability of an individual to be initiators of their own actions and assume psychological freedom when engaging in experiences. It can be supported through choice, acknowledgment of feelings, and opportunities for self-direction. The RMS1 app enables users to have in-game choices over goals and strategies and experience varied opportunities for action in the solo mode, to advance through challenges and levels in the tutorial. Achieving a greater feeling of like one has control over things they do enriches users’ intrinsic motivation.\nSolo mode: Various choices and control options are available here. Default, the solo mode will lead users to the FPV screen, so they can see what the robot sees and they can move the robot around by dragging the virtual joysticks. Users can remotely control many components of the robot, such as controlling the chassis\u0026rsquo; omnidirectional movement, controlling the gimbal\u0026rsquo;s movement in three axial directions, and trying to use the function of recognizing visual markers, recognizing pedestrians, and recognizing hand gestures. In this process, users will implicitly experience some STEM concepts or phenomena, such as how the distance between the marker and the camera changes the robot\u0026rsquo;s perspective. After knowing the basic operation of controlling the robot, the solo mode allows players to advance through different two-game challenges or to explore the physical world freely. The choices to continuously balance their boundless curiosity against a finite pool of resources. For further challenge and learning, there is a function that leads players to move on to the Lab. This Custom skills button from image: User can equip their own code as a function during race or combat with others. The enjoyment, and satisfaction from the solo and battle mode lit up the intrinsic motivation to make users want to level up their robot.\nLab:\nWhen the user leaves solo mode and goes to learn through tutorials in the lab, they are actually showing a desire for progression to develop more skills in the robot. They have three formats of learning to choose from in the Lab:\n\u0026ldquo;Road to Mastery\u0026rdquo;: Learn by following project-based tutorials. \u0026ldquo;DIY Programming\u0026rdquo; is a programming playground. If anyone wants to go deeper into coding, the RMS1 also supports Python here. \u0026ldquo;RoboAcademy\u0026rdquo;: access to video courses, programming guide, and developer documentation. Free selection of a task indicates users’ motivation to perform the task (Pintrich \u0026amp; Schunk, 2002). When a user chooses to become a learner in \u0026ldquo;Road to Mastery,\u0026rdquo; one can select tutorials based on difficulty and knowledge. In Figure 2-4, the icons at the lower right corner of each tutorial indicate the direction of expertise for that tutorial. For example, in the Beginner Guide, the two icons point to \u0026ldquo;programming\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;control.\u0026rdquo; Each tutorial has demo videos that introduce learners to the covered knowledge and skills. Ideally, by providing three different learning modes (Road to Mastery, DIY Programming, RoboAcademy), learners have the freedom to choose when and where they want to learn. The Lab strives to generate almost limitless learning activities and thus support the choice of each learner, which further increases their sense of autonomy and enhances learners\u0026rsquo; motivation.\nRelatedness - “I want to be closer to other people.” # Relatedness is feeling cared for and connected meaningfully to others. It has to do with a sense of belonging, a feeling that you matter to the other people there. Relatedness is enhanced not just by people treating you warmly and including you, but your giving also enhances it to them, and you are able to matter in their lives. That\u0026rsquo;s part of what helps us feel connected. So, it\u0026rsquo;s not a one-way street to relatedness. It has to do with both. Compared to learning about STEM with a computer or a book, learning with a robot can leave a strong impression on users. Their tangible user interface and body attract users’ attention(Kanda, 2004). A study about the impact of using an educational robot even predicted that robots are highly likely to become successful social actors in mixed-reality environments(Chin, Hong \u0026amp; Chen, 2014).\nCommunity of Practices # After all, the innate need for relatedness is more about belongingness and connectedness with others. The learning experience with RM introduces users to a club of robotics lovers, where people have various forms of playing and learning together. Participating in the club is an informal, continuous, and naturally occurring learning process, Lave and Wenger (1991) used the term “community of practice” to describe such a place where interactions happen between novices and experts and the process by which newcomers create a professional identity. The user base of RM is from different levels of participation. Like professional programmers, engineers, and down to young children who just started to learn scratch. There is a knowledge-sharing forum for RM lovers and many WeChat groups, where participants come to learn from one another with a focus on problem-solving and innovation. These communities of practice gather to discuss topics related to a specific task or role that each member has in common. It creates an environment of shared experience that enables participants to compare methods and processes – benefiting all. This also establishes a “safe space” that enables users and learners to develop social bonds, allowing them to cooperate with geographically remote peers (Przybylski, Rigby \u0026amp; Ryan, 2010). Physically, there are local RM clubs in major cities in China, where users can find and give support, meet, and participate the in-person events.\nThe satisfaction of all these three psychological needs by the features of learning with RM leads to a greater level of motivation. Frequently, the interrelation within them can promote a higher level of self-determination within individuals.\nZPD and scaffolding # In the previous sections, I only assumed the age of users but did not set an entry threshold for STEM knowledge. It is essential for such an app designed for users to provide enough scaffolding to support users from different knowledge bases and encourage them to explore and learn actively. To do so, first, however, it is difficult for the app designer to know the level of development of the user to complete the task independently without help. Secondly, it is also challenging to see the level of the user\u0026rsquo;s capability when working with capable others. The distance between those two unknowns is what Vygotsky called the “zone of proximal development”(1978).\nRMS1 app’s predefined user scenario could be all users learn from scratch. Thus at the beginning, the learning opportunity matches the learner\u0026rsquo;s prior knowledge and experiences. However, ​​the pace of learning development could be very different, which requires different motivational schemas that enable them to understand the domain\u0026rsquo;s value and experience its satisfactions (Brophy, 1999). In an informal learning environment, the app itself does not examine the user\u0026rsquo;s existing knowledge at all. However, as far as I know, this product is also used in formal teaching as a STEM explory course in schools and tutoring organizations. I believe that the teacher\u0026rsquo;s guidance can significantly enhance learners\u0026rsquo; development.\nSolo mode:\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t find many features that work as scaffolding in the solo section. For people who are used to remotely controlling robots or racing cars with joysticks, it looks like they don\u0026rsquo;t need any learning to operate RMS1. However, they probably have never controlled the gimbal movement, the movement of individual wheels. The UI of this section would be better if it showed direct visual cues to help users better adapt to the robot\u0026rsquo;s essential remote control. Then introduce the different components of the robot. It is also important to design the timing of the appearance of these direct instructions. Once users have mastered the operation of a particular part of the robot, introducing a new component can further encourage them to learn.\nLab:\nThe tutorials in the Lab cover different levels of difficulty. The content knowledge includes core programming skills of robot control and AI, supporting game performance. Each of the tutorials is divided into several chapters. When users complete a chapter, they receive feedback on whether they have programmed it correctly. In addition, the app automatically saves all the content they programmed in the tutorial, so users don\u0026rsquo;t need to start from scratch when they log out. Furthermore, on the home page of the tutorial, users can see their progress for each tutorial. As the user passes through tutorials, they begin to master different categories of programming blocks. For example, the first tutorial simply teaches how to program the robot chassis. This particular tutorial has a refined version that controls each of the four wheels to present the same effect of preventing the robot chassis. Such design features allow users to continue having feelings of competence through the challenges available to players. Also, it enables feelings of autonomy through possibilities to create complex control for the robot. Towards the increasing need for programming, except for the in-app tutorials, there are many user-generated tutorials in the forum, provided by ‘more knowledgeable others.\u0026rsquo; There is also a thread of Q\u0026amp;A, which offers more assistance when users get stuck in the tutorial.\nGamification # Gamified elements can be found almost everywhere in the RMS1 app. Like many massive online games, the app even has a MasterBoard that shows the user\u0026rsquo;s personal data and global rankings. These gamified experiences can intrinsically and extrinsically motivate users to reach more goals. For example, practice controlling the robot to travel longer distances, write more lines of code, complete more tutorials, etc.\nThe automatic driving challenge from Battle mode asks users to utilize vision markers to create \u0026ldquo;traffic lights\u0026rdquo; and other obstacles. Users can write their own programs that allow the S1 to drive automatically and execute complex tasks. Explore mathematical principles involving robotic control and motion mechanics through the S1\u0026rsquo;s programmable artificial intelligence modules. Get an in-depth understanding of AI as you develop these skills and many more. Such learning experience covers knowledge, principles, information, and skills that need to be mastered.\nIn a formal setting, schools would choose to focus on the learning and have teachers teach students directly. But with RMS1, that content can be gained by learners from the game design. Modern learning theory suggests the situated learning approach is the better one(Shaffer, 2008). Learning with robots and with those gamified elements makes the uptake of knowledge and skills much more subtle than learning about STEM in the classroom.\nMy Personal Experience with RMS1 # I was involved in the development of the app and the robot. Before this experience, I only had knowledge of computer science, programming, and AI, and very little understanding of robotics. Through the tutorials in the app and the video tutorials from RoboAcademy, I learned a lot more about robotics and mechanical engineering. Before the pandemic, I used to see many teen users quickly get attracted to RoboMaster and started spending a lot of time on the app. On the other hand, I have also seen many users lose interest soon after purchase. Since I\u0026rsquo;m an RMS1 user myself, I entered the RM weChat group and got in touch with a few users who were willing to talk with me about their experiences with RMS1.\nI approached 8 RMS1 users aged 15-36. They have all used RMS1 for more than six months. Since the user groups I reached were all from China, the interviews were originally communicated in Mandarin. I prepared an outline of the interview and translated it into Chinese to have a conversation with the interviewees. I recorded the conversation and translated important information to present in this study.\nFindings # General： All eight of them have tried three main functions, but two users were not able to find local players to experience the battle mode. Among them, the most popular function is the Lab. More specifically, the DIY programming. All of them have tried Road to Mastery but none of them completed all the tutorials. Competence: All of them agreed that they felt having fun while using the RM. Only one interviewee was not sure about his programming made the robot stronger. He believes that it is his control that improves the robot. Autonomy: All of them thought that their are in control of the learning process. Most of them don\u0026rsquo;t have a preference for choosing tutorials, they follow the original tutorial order. 5 of them watched the video courses and found the contents helpful. Relatedness: All of them expressed that they found it easy to access the forum, and they found the link to the weChat group from the forum. They agreed on all the questions in the Relatedness section. Overall Assessment of the Experience # Strengths and limits in terms of motivation and learning # The RoboMaster S1 app demonstrates significant strengths in cultivating intrinsic motivation among its users, particularly through its adherence to the principles outlined in Self-Determination Theory. By providing experiences that foster a sense of competence, autonomy, and relatedness, the app succeeds in engaging learners and sustaining their interest in STEM topics and robotics. The competence dimension is well-supported through features like progressive tutorial difficulties, performance feedback mechanisms, and opportunities to showcase mastery in coding challenges and battle scenarios. Users interviewed expressed feeling a genuine sense of fun and enjoyment from operating the robot, indicating that the experiences effectively tap into their inner motivational resources. Autonomy is nurtured by offering choices in learning pathways, customizable programming options, and flexibility in exploration within the virtual and physical environments. The ability to personalize aspects of their robot enhances feelings of control and self-direction in the learning process. Perhaps most notably, the app cultivates a sense of relatedness by connecting users to a vibrant community of robotics enthusiasts. Through forums, local clubs, and sharing capabilities, learners can seek support, collaborate with peers, and feel a sense of belonging to a collective endeavor. This social dimension is critical for sustaining long-term engagement. However, the app does have some limitations, particularly in providing adaptive scaffolding tailored to individual learners\u0026rsquo; zones of proximal development. Without mechanisms to assess existing knowledge and skills, the app cannot dynamically adjust the level of support and instructional content to optimally challenge each user. This one-size-fits-all approach may lead to frustration for some and a lack of depth for others. Furthermore, the dual objectives of the app - facilitating both robot control and STEM concept learning - could potentially create conflicting design priorities. Trying to serve these distinct purposes within a single interface may dilute the effectiveness of each experience.\nSuggestions # To enhance the learning experience, a key suggestion would be to decouple the control/gameplay aspects from the explicit educational components. This could allow for deeper focus and optimization of each domain. The control and battle interfaces could retain their gamified, engaging nature while integrating more seamlessly with insights from gaming psychology and human-robot interaction principles. Introducing narrative elements, progressive difficulty curves, and dynamic feedback loops could further elevate the immersion and motivation to master robot operation. Conversely, the learning environment would benefit from techniques inspired by adaptive educational technologies and intelligent tutoring systems. Implementing mechanisms to regularly assess user understanding through interactive exercises or knowledge probes would provide valuable data to personalize subsequent content presentation. An ideal adaptive learning system could use this data to determine the most appropriate next concepts, examples, or practice problems for each individual based on their demonstrated proficiencies and knowledge gaps. The level of scaffolding and guidance could dynamically adjust, gradually transferring more responsibility to the learner as their competence in a given area grows. Integrating multi-modal instruction beyond just text and visuals, such as interactive simulations, animated pedagogical agents, or even direct guidance from human experts, could further enrich the breadth of learning experiences available. Additionally, incorporating principles from constructionist learning theory could empower users to build and create personally meaningful artifacts that aid their understanding of complex concepts. The robot itself provides a tangible medium for this constructionist approach. From a practical standpoint, closer integration with formal educational contexts like classrooms would allow the app to complement and extend school-based learning activities. Teachers could monitor student progress, identify struggling areas, and seamlessly incorporate RoboMaster into their curriculum using learning management system integrations.\nBias and Limitations # It\u0026rsquo;s important to acknowledge the inherent biases and limitations present in this assessment. As a previous developer involved with RoboMaster S1, there is an inherent affinity and natural inclination to perceive the product\u0026rsquo;s strengths favorably while potentially overlooking or rationalizing its shortcomings. This \u0026ldquo;innovator\u0026rsquo;s bias\u0026rdquo; is a well-documented phenomenon and should be accounted for. Moreover, the insights gathered from user interviews may not fully represent the general population\u0026rsquo;s experiences. The individuals interviewed were already active community members invested in the product\u0026rsquo;s ecosytem. Their perspectives could be skewed toward the more motivated and engaged end of the user spectrum. To gain a more comprehensive understanding, additional research involving a broader, more representative sample of users across various demographic groups, skill levels, and engagement levels would be beneficial. This could uncover further motivational barriers, usability hurdles, or untapped opportunities that this initial assessment may have missed. Furthermore, while the theories and principles applied here, such as Self-Determination Theory and Zones of Proximal Development, are well-established, their specific applications and interactions within the context of a robot-based STEM learning environment have not been exhaustively validated empirically. More controlled studies isolating and measuring the impact of individual design elements would strengthen the evidence base. Despite these limitations, the assessment provides a valuable foundation for iterating on the RoboMaster S1 experience and informing the development of future educational robotics solutions. Continuous user research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and a willingness to adapt based on data and feedback will be crucial for maximizing the product\u0026rsquo;s potential to inspire and enrich STEM learning.\nThe design of RMS1 and its application focus heavily on motivational aspects, using elements from Self-Determination Theory (SDT). SDT suggests that intrinsic motivation is enhanced when activities meet basic psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness:\nCompetence: Users feel capable as they navigate through different modes, facing challenges that match their skill levels. Autonomy: The app offers various choices that empower users to control their learning pathways and strategies. Relatedness: Users are part of a community of robotics enthusiasts, enhancing the social aspect of learning. References # Barker, B., \u0026amp; Ansorge, J. (2007).

The design of this programming card is to enable younger children to experience the joy of AI programming and interacting with robots.\nIt includes a total of 30 fun levels, encouraging players to use code to control the chassis, turret, and other parts of the S1 robot to complete tasks such as \u0026ldquo;cross-stepping\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;dancing a twist waist dance.\u0026rdquo; The challenge card integrates physical and mathematical knowledge points into the tasks, allowing children to learn abstract concepts through robots. The difficulty of the tasks will gradually increase with the progress of the challenge, adapting to players with different levels of knowledge. We integrate knowledge from physics, mathematics, and other disciplines into programming tasks, helping children to connect abstract concepts with practical applications for interdisciplinary learning.\nEach challenge card features an independent task. Users need to follow the clues on the card to determine and fill in the missing code information, enabling the robot to smoothly execute the task and complete the level. I actually embeded a little hint: The color of each card actually corresponds to the colors displayed by the various programming modules in the RoboMaster app. I believe you will soon discover the secrets to conquering the challenges! We have organized some offline activities in our stores and clubs across the country, inviting children to come and play.\nDesign Philosophy: # User-Centered: All designs revolve around the learning needs and interests of the users—the children. Interactivity: Through interaction with the RoboMaster S1, children learn programming in a playful environment. Adaptability: The challenge card\u0026rsquo;s difficulty adapts to children of different ages and knowledge levels, ensuring every child can learn at their own pace. Educational Value: Ensuring the programming challenge card is not just a tool for entertainment but also an educational product that imparts knowledge and cultivates skills. Innovation: Encouraging children to think innovatively, not confined to standard answers, seeking multiple possible solutions. Educational Attributes Introduction: # This programming challenge card adheres to constructivist learning theory, an education approach centered on the student, emphasizing the construction of knowledge through active engagement and social interaction.\nChildren will learn the basics of programming and understand the working principles of robots through hands-on operation with the RoboMaster S1, deepening their understanding and retention through doing.\nThe programming challenge card is designed with tasks that escalate in complexity, starting with simple commands and progressively guiding children to master more advanced programming concepts and skills.\nEach level is a mini-challenge, requiring children to think critically and apply their knowledge to find solutions, fostering their problem-solving abilities.\nThrough the immediate feedback from the RoboMaster S1, children can quickly understand whether their programming is correct, with timely positive or negative feedback helping them adjust their learning strategies.\nAreas for Future Improvement: # During our testing phase, we have identified two key areas that require further enhancement to ensure a more comprehensive and engaging educational experience with this card set.\nFirstly, Social Interaction needs to be more robustly integrated into the challenge card\u0026rsquo;s design. While the current setup allows for teamwork, there is a need to create more structured opportunities for children to engage in meaningful discussions, collaboration, and communication within a team setting. This could involve designing tasks that specifically require collective problem-solving and peer-to-peer interaction to foster a deeper understanding of teamwork dynamics.\nSecondly, Creativity Cultivation is another area that can be further developed. Although the open-ended tasks are intended to inspire imaginative thinking, we aim to provide additional support and guidance to help children explore a wider range of creative solutions. This may include offering more varied and complex challenges that push the boundaries of conventional thinking, as well as incorporating elements that encourage children to experiment with different approaches and to appreciate the process of innovation.\nBy focusing on these areas, we can refine the programming challenge card to not only enhance the educational value but also to inspire a richer learning experience that nurtures both social skills and creative problem-solving abilities in children.\nPersonal Notes I am very grateful for taking charge of this project and working with cross-functional team members. I thank the UI/UX team for making such beatiful designs out of my text descriptions. Also, the marketing team and our local store colleagues, thank you for organizing amazing events.\n","date":"28 3月 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/1724822446642-programming-cards/","section":"Projects","summary":"This is an educational tool I designed in line with constructivist learning theory, aiming to stimulate children\u0026rsquo;s creativity and problem-solving abilities.","title":"Learn with RoboMaster Programming Challenge Card","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"28 3月 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/learning-design/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Learning Design","type":"tags"},{"content":" RoboMaster S1 supports two powerful programming languages, Scratch and Python. The scratch programming consists of 46 programmable blocks, six categories of AI programming modules, and a vast array of programming blocks, coupled with six PWM interfaces.

We aim to achieve this by integrating project-based learning modules that are not only instructive but also stimulating.\nBy facilitating real-time interactions with the robot, learners are given the opportunity to delve into the intricacies of mechanical systems and gain a hands-on appreciation for the principles that govern them. This tactile approach to learning is complemented by an immersive exposure to artificial intelligence technologies.\nOur course is meticulously crafted to guide learners through a series of progressively challenging projects, each designed to illuminate different aspects of programming and robotics. Through this journey, we aspire to cultivate curiosity, critical thinking, and a deep appreciation for the fusion of technology and intelligence.\nAs learners navigate through the \u0026ldquo;Road to Mastery\u0026rdquo; course, they will not only develop proficiency in programming with the \u0026ldquo;RoboMaster S1\u0026rdquo; but also gain insights into the broader implications of AI in the context of modern robotics.\n","date":"28 10月 2019","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/1724828637006-road-to-the-mastery/","section":"Projects","summary":"RoboMaster S1 supports two powerful programming languages, Scratch and Python.","title":"Road to the Mastery","type":"projects"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ja/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ja/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ja/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ja/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"学習者 | 研究者 | デザイナー\nこんにちは、私のウェブサイトへようこそ! 私の研究の方向は、K12教育とコンピュータインタラクション技術の融合です。私は学習環境を豊かにするための革新的な方法を設計しており、データを活用して学生の協力と学習プロセスの洞察を明らかにしています。同期目の動き追跡から個々の学習アルゴリズムまで、私は常に教育をすべての学生にとって魅力的で、よりアクセスしやすく、効果的にすることを探求しています。 私の現在の研究は日本語の学習中であり、あなたとの交流を楽しみにしています。","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ja/","section":"こんにちは","summary":"学習者 | 研究者 | デザイナー","title":"こんにちは","type":"page"}]
